<h2 id="drilling-into-the-atlantis-massif-to-search-for-rock-powered-life">Drilling into the Atlantis Massif to Search for Rock-Powered Life</h2>
<p>I have had the wonderful opportunity to participate in two seafloor
drilling expeditions (IODP Expeditions 357 and 399) to investigate
subseafloor life in the chain of submarine mountains in the middle of
the Atlantic Ocean known as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. These expeditions
targeted one mountain, in particular, named the Atlantis Massif, because
it is primarily composed of one special kind of rock called
“serpentinite”. Serpentinites are formed when rocks from the Earth’s
mantle are uplifted and exposed to water and thereby “serpentinized”, a
geochemical process that releases hydrogen gas (H2) and is thought to
have played a role in the origin of life. The process of
serpentinization fuels a whole ecosystem of diverse microbes in the huge
chimneys of the <a href="/lostcity">Lost City hydrothermal field</a>, and it may be
responsible for <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/science/
enceladus/">the ongoing geysers emanating from
Enceladus</a>.</p>

<h3 id="a-major-goal-of-this-expedition-was-to-investigate-the-relationship-between-serpentinization-and-life-so-that-we-can-better-understand-the-origin-and-early-evolution-of-life-on-earth-and-to-inform-the-search-for-life-on-other-worlds-where-serpentinization-is-expected-to-occur"><strong><em>A major goal of this expedition was to investigate the relationship between serpentinization and life so that we can better understand the origin and early evolution of life on Earth and to inform the search for life on other worlds where serpentinization is expected to occur.</em></strong></h3>

<p>In order to search for life inside these serpentinite rocks, we had to
drill into the seafloor. Typically, ocean drilling (either for
scientific research or for oil exploration) is conducted in seabed
sediments, which are basically compacted mud. In some parts of the
ocean, these sediments can accumulate into columns thousands of
kilometers thick, which are scientifically and economically valuable for
many reasons. It is very rare for ocean drilling expeditions to drill
into the bedrock underneath the sediments because 1) there are currently
no profitable resources to be extracted from the bedrock <a href="/deep-sea-mining/">(but that may
change in the near future)</a> and 2) drilling into hard
rock on the seafloor is extremely challenging from an engineering
perspective.</p>
